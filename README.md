# AWA5.0 tools

This set of tools are meant to be used with the [AWA5.0 project](https://github.com/TempTempai/AWA5.0).

With the `bin.py` file, you can turn *awatalk* into a common string with a sequence of 0s and 1s.

With the `disasm.py` file, you can turn the previously generated 
string into *awatisms*
